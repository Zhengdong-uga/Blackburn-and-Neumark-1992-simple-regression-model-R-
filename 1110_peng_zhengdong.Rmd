In this final problem you will replicate some of the analysis in B.3 of assignment 1 using a different sample from the NLSYM.  The data come from [Blackburn and Neumark (1992)](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/107/4/1421/1846978?redirectedFrom=fulltext) (hereafter, BN) and are available in the `wage2` dataset of the `wooldridge` package.  BN's sample is based on the 1980 survey year, but it is otherwise similar to the Card (1995) sample you used in assignment 1. You will find a description of the variables in the referenced dataset through the Help tab in the Plot pane of RStudio. You will also find a description in their paper.

Unlike in the homework assignments, you will be a little more "off the chain" here. First, you will have to fill out the code chunk on your own.  Don't fret though, because you have everything you need in assignment 1. Plus, there is TAL if you get really stuck. Second, the analysis write-up is less scripted by the instructions, so you will have to string the relevant sentences together on your own.

(a) Begin by constructing a table of summary statistics for the main model variables (`wage`, `educ`, `exper`, `black`, `south`, `urban`) that reports the mean, standard deviation, min and max. Write a short paragraph describing the sample based on the table you constructed.

(b) Estimate the return to schooling controlling for `exper` and its square, `black`, `south`, and `urban`. Then, as in assignment 1, address the concern that the estimated education coefficient is biased because the model does not control for unobserved ability by adding `IQ` as a proxy. The sample also provides each young man's Knowledge of the World of Work (`KWW`) score.  In a third and final regression, add `KWW` as an additional proxy for unobserved ability.  

    Present your results in a proper table using `modelsummary` report standard errors that are robust to heteroscedasticity.  Write a short paragraph interpreting the returns-to-schooling estimates from this analysis, being sure to indicated whether they are statistically significant. An obvious approach to this paragraph would be to start with a sentence about the finding in Column (1) and then proceed to columns (2) and (3) highlighting how the results change.

**Answers**

(a) The summary statistics table reported that all variables has 935 samples constructed, the average wage among these samples is 957.95 with minimum wage of 115 and maximum wage of 3078. The `black`, `south`, and `urban` are dummy variables that only has values 0 or 1. By viewing the mean, min and max, the unit of wage should be monthly dollar amount, and the unit of educ&exper should be years. 

(b) For estimating the log wage return, firstly, use the simple regression model on `exper` and its square, `black`, `south`, and `urban`. I have noticed that the wage2 dataset has no expersq column, so I mutated a new column into the dataset. Secondly, create a second model for adding `IQ` as a proxy. Then create the third model for adding the knowledge of world work score. Combine 3 models and create a coefficient map which contains all added variables and then create a good-of-fit map. Construct a table of results for the combined model by using the modelsummary function, the vcov option is included to report standard errors that are robust to heteroscedasticity.I have also include p-values into the table. The p-values shows that all results are statistically significant at 1% level except for experience and its square. Also, in Column (1) and then proceed to columns (2) and (3), the result is decreasing by adding IQ and KWW.
